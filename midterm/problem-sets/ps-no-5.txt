Problem Set No. 5

Create a function that will accept an array of numbers (in any order) and filter it (by odd or even) and assign to two arrays.
It should be built using loops.

Note: Only use one function and you can call this function twice (for odd and even application).
Hint: make use of optional named parameter OR an extra argument to identify if calculating odd or even.

Example:

function input => [10, 1, 2, 2, 5]
odd output => [1, 5]
even output => [10, 2, 2]

Exam No. 2

Create a function that will accept an array of numbers (in any order) and sort it from largest to smallest.

It should be built using loops.

Example:

```
function input => [55, 1, 3, 2, 10]
output => [55, 10, 3, 2, 1]
```

Another example:

```
function input => [10, -30, 0, -2, 3]
output => [10, 3, 0, -2, -30]
```
